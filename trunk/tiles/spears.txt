# ID, classification/Name, image seuence, physics, animation delay
# each column is separated with with tabs
#
# ID:
# must be unique
#
# classification:
# will determine which group the tile will appear in in the map editor
#
# Name
# will be the user-friendly name of the tile. 
# Cannot contain tabs or slashes. 
# Spaces are okay.
#
# Image sequence
# A list of files in the /images/tiles/ directory. 
# Leave off the .png.
# Leave off /images/tiles/
# If this is an animated sequence of tiles, then 
# put | characters between each file name.
# This column is optional: if this column is omitted, then the tile will be blank
# 
# physics
# This determines how the tile will behave
# Choices:
# - passable
# - unpassable
# - platform
# - incline_up
# - incline_down
# - ladder
# - water
# - shallow_incline_up_lower - this is for the left tile of inclines with a slope of 1/2
# - shallow_incline_up_upper - this is for the right tile of inclines with a slope of 1/2
# - shallow_incline_down_lower - this is for the right tile of inclines with a slope of -1/2
# - shallow_incline_down_upper - this is for the left tile of inclines with a slope of -1/2
# - spikes
#
# animation delay
# If you have multiple images for an animation, this determines 
# the frame rate of the animation
# This parameter is optional and obviously not required if there is only 1 image.
# If omitted for an animated sequence, then a framerate of 4 is used
